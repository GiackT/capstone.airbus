Capstone Project on Airbus Fuel Leak Data

The historical data itself contained time-series data coming from the sensors on the
planes for every flight. There are 111 different features or columns some of the
datasets, while MSN02 only contains 19 variables:

The data consisted of the following:
● A/C and flight data:
● Time, day, month, year and UTC date/time.
● MSN and Flight number.
● Flight phase.
● Altitude, pitch and roll.

Fuel/Engine system data:
● Engine status (Running or not).
● Fuel flow (to each engine)
● Fuel used (by engines).
● Fuel on board (“FOB”).
● Fuel quantity per collector cell and surge tank volume.
● Pump status (On/Off, normally/abnormally, immersed/not immersed).
● Leak detection and leak flow.
● Fuel transfer mode.
